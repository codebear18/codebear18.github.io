  <h3 class="post-title">Meet the Guinea Pigs</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p> I have two guinea pigs. Peanut and Pumpkin are my adorable<br>
      little balls of fur, which are, in my opinion, one of the <br>
      <strong>cutest</strong> pets you could get.
    </p>
    <p>
      They love to snuggle, and will do<br>
      <em>anything</em> for a fresh bell pepper. Peanut is a shy little pig who<br>
      lives for a plate of veggies. Pumpkin is an independent fur ball who<br>
      is a big snuggle bug. My Guinea pigs are so cute and they both<br>
      will always be special to me.

  <h3 class="post-title">Puppy Trouble</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
      I have two german shepherds. German shepherds are <br>
      my <strong>favorite</strong> type of dog. They are extremely loyal and <br>
      very protective. Casey is the middle dog. She is six <br>
      and is always very calm. She is <em>super</em> fluffy and she <br>
      loves to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy is the polar opposite. She is only a year old, so she is <br>
      really hyper. She is 90 lbs and she is a total lap dog. She <br>
      will, without warning, jump on top of you and decide to just <br>
      sit there for a while. She loves to eat tiles off the floor<br>
      in the kitchen, and has an appitite for just about everything...

  <h3 class="post-title">Evil Dog</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
      My dog Gracie is quite evil. I mean, she can be sweet at <br>
      some times but most of the time, she is just plain <strong>evil</strong>.<br>
      I think that she may just be a cat. She lays around all <br>
      day long, and completely ignores most people, unless food<br>
      is involved. She is a beagle, but she is the <em>smallest</em> <br>
      beagle I have ever seen. I honestly think she hates me if I <br>
      don't have food for her at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      She always wants to eat and will not stop eating as long<br>
      as there is food in front of her. Because of this, she may <br>
      have gotten a little... over weight. However, she has shed a <br>
      few extra pounds on her diet. She is 10 years old, so she <br>
      is the grandma of my dog family. Even Lucy, who is about <br>
      three times her size, is scared of her. She is pretty <br>
      feisty for how small she is, but she is still super <br>
      sweet and lovable at times.

  <h3 class="post-title">New Puppy</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p> I just got a new puppy! Her name is Rosie, and she is the <strong>sweetest</strong> puppy ever.<br>
      She loves to give hugs, and will not hesitate in diving onto your lap to be pet.<br>
      She is Lucy's new best friend and they love to play together. Lucy is very excited<br>
      to have another puppy around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosie is <em>very</em> playful. She loves to play with all of her toys, and she <br>
      is not big on sharing. She is learning quickly, she already knows sit, stay, and <br>
      we're still working on getting her off the sofa. She is an extremely happy little<br>
      addition to my family of pets and I know we are all very happy to have her.
