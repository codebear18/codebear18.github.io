    <p>Alice pulled back the old, musty curtain, and stared out into the street.<br>
      She had heard that the town used to be a bustling city. Any indication of that <br>
      past was long gone. Most of the homes looked like they hadn't been lived in<br>
      in years, and it was true for most of them. No one was ever on the streets, <br>
      no sound ever came from the buildings. Alice turned from the window and hurried <br>
      down the stairs. The sun was barely peeking over the tops of the abandoned <br>
      buildings, shedding weak beams of light over the city. Alice took the side <br>
      roads, avoiding the main streets at all costs. She knew that most buildings <br>
      were empty, but she didn't want to take that chance. She wanted to be sure <br>
      that no one was following her. After what seemed like forever, she finally <br>
      reached her destination. It was an old home, the door falling off its <br>
      hinges. She slowly opened the creaky door and stepped onto the hard <br>
      floor. She was hoping to find some sort of food in the kitchen. She<br>
      doubted she'd find anything, but sometimes, if she was lucky she find <br>
      cans of tuna or even an occasional canned chicken. She hadn't seen <br>
      any fruits or vegetables for over 10 years. She never expected to either.<br>
      12 years prior, when Alice was only two, wildfires began to sweep the nation.<br>
      No country had the abilty, or resources to stop the raging wildfires. Each <br>
      one was seemingly larger than the last, and they showed no sign of stopping.<br>
      Eventually, after years of burning, they finally died out. However, the <br>
      entire Earth was completely decimated. Most of the population was gone<br>
      and there were few surviving animals. Plants, however, took the biggest<br>
      toll. Alice remembered the day. She was six years old, sitting on her <br>
      mother's lap, listening to the radio. "Last one...save us all...flower" <br>
      the radio cut in and out. She understood the message anyway. They had <br>
      found it. The last surviving plant. They had hope. They could bring <br>
      the plants back, which could keep the animals alive, which would <br>
      keep the people alive for hopefully enough time for them to find a <br>
      permanent solution. The hope fizzled out in a few weeks. The flower was<br>
      dead. The public spiraled into anarchy. People rioted, and many didn't <br>
      survive. The population dwindled down into just about 30,000. She knew that <br>
      the food supplies, and the population would eventually die off. Alice finished <br>
      scouring the kitchen for food. She sighed, and was about to move on to the next<br>
      house until a hand clamped over her mouth and she was jerked backwards.<br>

      Alice couldn't see anything. She had something over her head and she <br>
      could tell she was in a tight spot. The last thing she remembers is being <br>
      pulled backward by strong hands. She couldn't remember anything after that.<br>
      She was moving now. Maybe on a train, or possibly in a car, though not many <br>
      still had gas saved from before they ran out. She pushed against the walls around <br>
      her. They were hard, and smooth. She knew that she wouldn't be able to escape. <br>
      She was planning how she would get away from her captors when harsh sunlight <br>
      hit her eyes. She saw two large shadows looming over her. "She's the one?"<br>
      One of the voices spoke gruffly. "Maybe. We're hoping." A soft, female voice <br>
      spoke back. "Now, Harold, let's bring the young lady inside." The woman said.<br>
      Suddenly, Alice was grabbed by her arms and was pulled towards a huge building.<br>
      The building had huge steel walls and a tall barbed wire fence outside. <br>
      The woman pulled a card out of her pocket and scanned it on a small screen.<br>
      The fence swung open and Alice was taken inside. Once she was inside, she saw <br>
      hundreds of people in white coats, like doctors, rushing up and down the long <br>
      corridors. She glanced at the man the woman had called Harold. He looked nervous<br>
      in this environment, like he was obviously out of place. He and the woman walked<br>
      quickly to a set of huge metal doors at the end of the hall. The woman punched in<br>
      a few numbers on a keypad and the doors clicked open. Alice was escorted inside, where <br>
      there were hundreds of the people in white coats surrounding a small table in the center<br>
      of the room. When Alice walked in, all heads turned to her. Then, the attention went <br>
      to the woman when she spoke, "Now, I know hopes are not as high as our last experiment <br>
      tuned out to be quite, <em>unpleasant</em>," She said the word as if it was toxic, and <br>
      she had to get the foul word out of her mouth."but I do hope that we can try once more <br>
      and hope for a much better outcome." Applause slowly overwhelmed the room as the <br>
      woman smiled. "Alice, where are my manners, my name is Doctor Graham, and we are all <br>
      very pleased to have you here." Alice had a million questions, but one took over her <br>
      mind more than the rest. "What happened to your last 'experiment'?" Alice asked tenatively<br>
      "Oh, hush, child, no need for you to be worrying about things like that." Her answer<br>
      did nouthing to relieve Alice's worry. "Come now," Doctor Graham said,"we have quite <br>
      a lot to show you."

     Luna stood on the rickety old dock and watched in terror as the home she'd known all her <br>
      life was engulfed in orange flames. She stared, as the flames hypnotically danced up the grey<br>
      walls. Then, in an instant, it was gone. Forever. Every childhood memory, gone with the black <br>
      smoke that filled the sky nowadays. The previous year, wildfires had broken out all over the world.<br>
      They slowly spread across villages, then cities, then countries. When the wildfires got too extreme,<br>
      too fast, the government made extreme changes to society. All cars and homes were a dull shade of grey,<br>
      and everyone had identical government-mandated clothing. Girls in a knee-length grey dress and boys in the<br>
      same monochromatic dress clothes. It was Luna's village's predetermined evacuation day, but no one was<br>
      really prepared to be ripped away from all they knew.  Guards dressed in black uniforms, each with a <br>
      small picture on their backs depicting the earth surrounded in a halo of fire. "Evacuees! Board now or <br>
      be burnt to a crisp." Luna grabbed her younger brother Luca's hand and briskly stepped in the long line <br>
      leading to a small boat, their key to a better life. After their parents were both killed in a fire after <br>
      being recruited to the dangerous and unenviable job of a firefighter. Most firefighters died in fires too<br>
      vast, too fast, or too fierce to be tamed. Luna pulled Luca's small hand as the line drew them closer to<br>
      the boat. Eventually, the line crept to the dock, and Luna and Luca boarded the boat. The small boat was<br>
      crammed full of passengers, and a long line was still winding down the burning streets when a large, surly <br>
      guard shut the gate cutting the arriving the passengers off. Luna heard an old woman from the front of the<br>
      line ask, "When will the next boat be?" The guard responded, "That's not my problem." Luna gasped. All of <br>
      these people would either struggle to get shelter or try to find another evacuation ship to catch. All <br>
      because their village wasn't large or important enough to get a larger boat sent for evacuation. She <br>
      felt Luca's small hand squeeze hers. "Lu? Where are we going?" Luca asked, his small voice quiet, and<br>
      full of terror. "To a better place. There's a place with no more fire, no more guards, just a quiet <br>
      little island with plenty of people, and plenty of room. "Can we paint out house green?" Luna chuckled, <br>
      green was Luca's favorite color, "Sure, Luca, we can paint the house green." "Yay!" As Luca danced of<br>
      excitement a woman approached Luna. "You sure are young to be out here all alone." The woman said cautiously.<br>
      "I'm not alone." Luna motioned to Luca. "That's my little brother Luca. I'm Luna by the way." "Oh, " the<br>
      woman said, "I'm Autumn." "Do you know where this place is? The place they told us about." Luna asked,<br>
      hoping the woman could shed some light on their situation, in which they were left completely in the <br>
      dark. The ship suddenly listed to the left, throwing everyone sideways. Luna landed on the floor with a thud, <br>
      the last thing she saw was the floor coming toward her as everything went dark.

    <p>
    When she finally came to, Luna awoke in a small white room. She was in a creaky, old cot with <br>
      thin, white sheets over her. She sat up and that was when she noticed the short woman standing<br>
      in the corner. "Hello, I'm Doctor Mullins." Luna stared at her. Checking a chart on the small<br>
      stand next to the bed, the doctor spoke, "Luna Graham. Any family on board?" She asked, staring <br>
      Luna straight in the eye. "Y-yes. My brother, Luca. He's only four, he can't take care of himself.<br>
      Is he okay?" Luna stumbled over her words, stomach in a knot of panic. "Oh yes. Your brother is fine." <br>
      She said as Luna struggled up from the bed. "No, no, stay right there. You're suffering from a minor <br>
      concussion, but you'll be back up in no time." Luna sighed, "Can I at least see my brother?" "Yes, <br>
      that can be arranged." After what seemed like forever, the clock hit 6:00 and Luca rushed into the <br>
      room, followed by Autumn, who, Luna had been informed, had been taking care of Luca all this time. <br>
      She hugged her brother and slowly slid out of bed to follow him up the winding staircase leading to<br>
      the deck. There were groups of people here and there above deck, but most were crammed below deck<br>
      hiding from the cold and the winds. Being out on the ocean was the only place where Luna felt that <br>
      she could forget all her troubles. She stared out at the calm blue waves lapping against the boat <br>
      and tried to forget her old home, her friends, the things she left behind, the old dog she had when <br>
      she was little that was banned when the fires had first begun. No matter how hard she tried, all the <br>
      memories stayed as clear as the blue waters beneath. She turned and watch Luca run around with another <br>
      little boy about his age. She watched as they danced and skipped around the deck, oblivious to all the<br>
      problems the world was facing, and unknowing to all the immense problems that were to come. “Luca! Time <br>
      to go inside.” Luca’s big brown eyes met Luna’s. “Please, please, please! Just five more minutes?” he pleaded.<br>
      “No, Luca. It’s almost time for dinner, and Autumn is waiting for us.” Luna led him down into the galley and <br>
      scanned the room for Autumn. Luna walked over to the table she’d spotted Autumn at and sat down. She sighed.<br>
      It had been three long days with nothing to do and a nervous tension in the air for any word of the so-called<br>
      safe-haven island. It was said that this new land was a thriving civilization and most importantly, free of<br>
      fires. Suddenly, a voice boomed over the PA system, “All passengers, I apologize for the inconvenience, but<br>
      our voyage will be an extra three days because of detours pertaining to extreme weather off the coast of the<br>
      island. We will be arriving in four days.” Cheers of excitement filled the galley. They would soon reach <br>
      their safe, new home. After dinner, Autumn and Luna went up to the deck. Luna watched the stars twinkle <br>
      and stared at the full, milky-white moon, which she was named after. Luca settled himself down next to her,<br>
      and soon Luna found him asleep. She wondered what the first thing she’d do when she got to the new land was.<br>
      Lost in her own thoughts, Luna fell asleep as well.

    <p>
When she woke, she found Luca shaking her, “He said we’ll be there soon! Almost there!” Luna was <br>
      confused, “Who?” Luca was getting impatient as he said, “The captain he said we might get there <br>
      today!” Luna sat up and rushed to her feet. She hurried to the side of the ship and looked out at<br>
      the foggy cloud covering the horizon. She watched for any signs of land, of life, even another boat <br>
      would be a reminder that there were other people out there, somewhere, hoping for the same chance at<br>
      a new life that they were. Her train of thought was derailed as an announcement blared through the<br>
      speakers, “We will be at the island in a matter of hours. All passengers must now gather in the galley.<br>
      Quickly!” Luna grabbed Luca by the hand and rushed down to the galley. A small screen was mounted on the<br>
      wall. “Is that everyone? I honestly don’t care. Enjoy the show.” A video began on the screen. A man and a <br>
      woman stood with a young boy between them. They walked toward a small pale orange colored house. They <br>
      opened the door to the sight of a barking dog. They walked through the cozy looking house to their backyard,<br>
      a white picket fence surrounded a thriving garden and a large swimming pool. The family turned toward the<br>
      camera and smiled as a large caption appeared at the bottom of the screen. It read, “Live a happy new life<br>
      on a fire free island” Luna couldn’t help but smile at the end of the video for excitement of the new life <br>
      she could give Luca. Her childhood memories were plagued with frequent fire drills, fire warnings, and burning<br>
      hot weather. She wanted better for Luca and she knew that this island could change all that. No more fires,<br>
      but a chance to start over with a new home and a new life. The ship suddenly came to an abrupt stop and Luna <br>
      fell off her chair. They had arrived. She rushed to the    upper-deck and toward the short pathway separating <br>
      the cramped boat from the expanse of land that she was very excited to call her new home. She took Luca’s hand <br>
      as the line surged forward. Her feet hit the soft, white sands of the beach and she and Luca stepped forward.<br>
      She looked at Luca, expecting to see a look of joy. Instead, she saw a look of pure fear in his eyes as he <br>
      blankly stared at the horizon. Her eyes scanned the island for signs of life. All she saw were trees and <br>
      forests. She didn’t understand what was frightening Luca so much. She turned back toward the boat and saw it<br>
      floating away from the shore. “Luca, look at our new home! Are you excited?” She asked her brother.<br>
      He looked at her slowly and shook his head. He then raised his frail arm and pointed to a sight that<br>
      was all too familiar to them both. Tendrils of thick, black smoke reaching up to the sky as if greeting <br>
      an old friend. They were promised no fires, free choice, and most importantly, no more unnecessary <br>
      deaths from impossible fire fights. It seemed to be too good to be true, but false hope was better <br>
      than no hope. She knew instantly that this smoke was from a fire. A fire that was not supposed to exist.<br>
      They were supposed to be safe, happy, they were supposed to. This was no safe-haven. This was a death-sentence.
