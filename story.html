    <p>Alice pulled back the old, musty curtain, and stared out into the street.<br>
      She had heard that the town used to be a bustling city. Any indication of that <br>
      past was long gone. Most of the homes looked like they hadn't been lived in<br>
      in years, and it was true for most of them. No one was ever on the streets, <br>
      no sound ever came from the buildings. Alice turned from the window and hurried <br>
      down the stairs. The sun was barely peeking over the tops of the abandoned <br>
      buildings, shedding weak beams of light over the city. Alice took the side <br>
      roads, avoiding the main streets at all costs. She knew that most buildings <br>
      were empty, but she didn't want to take that chance. She wanted to be sure <br>
      that no one was following her. After what seemed like forever, she finally <br>
      reached her destination. It was an old home, the door falling off its <br>
      hinges. She slowly opened the creaky door and stepped onto the hard <br>
      floor. She was hoping to find some sort of food in the kitchen. She<br>
      doubted she'd find anything, but sometimes, if she was lucky she find <br>
      cans of tuna or even an occasional canned chicken. She hadn't seen <br>
      any fruits or vegetables for over 10 years. She never expected to either.<br>
      12 years prior, when Alice was only two, wildfires began to sweep the nation.<br>
      No country had the abilty, or resources to stop the raging wildfires. Each <br>
      one was seemingly larger than the last, and they showed no sign of stopping.<br>
      Eventually, after years of burning, they finally died out. However, the <br>
      entire Earth was completely decimated. Most of the population was gone<br>
      and there were few surviving animals. Plants, however, took the biggest<br>
      toll. Alice remembered the day. She was six years old, sitting on her <br>
      mother's lap, listening to the radio. "Last one...save us all...flower" <br>
      the radio cut in and out. She understood the message anyway. They had <br>
      found it. The last surviving plant. They had hope. They could bring <br>
      the plants back, which could keep the animals alive, which would <br>
      keep the people alive for hopefully enough time for them to find a <br>
      permanent solution. The hope fizzled out in a few weeks. The flower was<br>
      dead. The public spiraled into anarchy. People rioted, and many didn't <br>
      survive. The population dwindled down into just about 30,000. She knew that <br>
      the food supplies, and the population would eventually die off. Alice finished <br>
      scouring the kitchen for food. She sighed, and was about to move on to the next
      house until a hand clamped over her mouth and she was jerked backwards.<br>

      Alice couldn't see anything. She had something over her head and she <br>
      could tell she was in a tight spot. The last thing she remembers is being <br>
      pulled backward by strong hands. She couldn't remember anything after that.<br>
      She was moving now. Maybe on a train, or possibly in a car, though not many <br>
      still had gas saved from before they ran out. She pushed against the walls around <br>
      her. They were hard, and smooth. She knew that she wouldn't be able to escape. <br>
      She was planning how she would get away from her captors when harsh sunlight <br>
      hit her eyes. She saw two large shadows looming over her. "She's the one?"<br>
      One of the voices spoke gruffly. "Maybe. We're hoping." A soft, female voice <br>
      spoke back. "Now, Harold, let's bring the young lady inside." The woman said.<br>
      Suddenly, Alice was grabbed by her arms and was pulled towards a huge building.<br>
      The building had huge steel walls and a tall barbed wire fence outside. <br>
      The woman pulled a card out of her pocket and scanned it on a small screen.<br>
      The fence swung open and Alice was taken inside. Once she was inside, she saw <br>
      hundreds of people in white coats, like doctors, rushing up and down the long <br>
      corridors. She glanced at the man the woman had called Harold. He looked nervous<br>
      in this environment, like he was obviously out of place. He and the woman walked<br>
      quickly to a set of huge metal doors at the end of the hall. The woman punched in<br>
      a few numbers on a keypad and the doors clicked open. Alice was escorted inside, where <br>
      there were hundreds of the people in white coats surrounding a small table in the center<br>
      of the room. When Alice walked in, all heads turned to her. Then, the attention went <br>
      to the woman when she spoke, "Now, I know hopes are not as high as our last experiment <br>
      tuned out to be quite, <em>unpleasant</em>," She said the word as if it was toxic, and <br>
      she had to get the foul word out of her mouth."but I do hope that we can try once more <br>
      and hope for a much better outcome." Applause slowly overwhelmed the room as the <br>
      woman smiled. "Alice, where are my manners, my name is Doctor Graham, and we are all <br>
      very pleased to have you here." Alice had a million questions, but one took over her <br>
      mind more than the rest. "What happened to your last 'experiment'?" Alice asked tenatively<br>
      "Oh, hush, child, no need for you to be worrying about things like that." Her answer<br>
      did nouthing to relieve Alice's worry. "Come now," Doctor Graham said,"we have quite <br>
      a lot to show you."
