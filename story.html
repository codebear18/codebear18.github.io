    <p>Alice pulled back the old, musty curtain, and stared out into the street.<br>
      She had heard that the town used to be a bustling city. Any indication of that <br>
      past was long gone. Most of the homes looked like they hadn't been lived in<br>
      in years, and it was true for most of them. No one was ever on the streets, <br>
      no sound ever came from the buildings. Alice turned from the window and hurried <br>
      down the stairs. The sun was barely peeking over the tops of the abandoned <br>
      buildings, shedding weak beams of light over the city. Alice took the side <br>
      roads, avoiding the main streets at all costs. She knew that most buildings <br>
      were empty, but she didn't want to take that chance. She wanted to be sure <br>
      that no one was following her. After what seemed like forever, she finally <br>
      reached her destination. It was an old home, the door falling off its <br>
      hinges. She slowly opened the creaky door and stepped onto the hard <br>
      floor. She was hoping to find some sort of food in the kitchen. She<br>
      doubted she'd find anything, but sometimes, if she was lucky she find <br>
      cans of tuna or even an occasional canned chicken. She hadn't seen <br>
      any fruits or vegetables for over 10 years. She never expected to either.<br>
      12 years prior, when Alice was only two, wildfires began to sweep the nation.<br>
      No country had the abilty, or resources to stop the raging wildfires. Each <br>
      one was seemingly larger than the last, and they showed no sign of stopping.<br>
      Eventually, after years of burning, they finally died out. However, the <br>
      entire Earth was completely decimated. Most of the population was gone<br>
      and there were few surviving animals. Plants, however, took the biggest<br>
      toll. Alice remembered the day. She was six years old, sitting on her <br>
      mother's lap, listening to the radio. "Last one...save us all...flower" <br>
      the radio cut in and out. She understood the message anyway. They had <br>
      found it. The last surviving plant. They had hope. They could bring <br>
      the plants back, which could keep the animals alive, which would <br>
      keep the people alive for hopefully enough time for them to find a <br>
      permanent solution. The hope fizzled out in a few weeks. The flower was<br>
      dead. The public spiraled into anarchy. People rioted, and many didn't <br>
      survive. The population dwindled down into just about 30,000. She knew that <br>
      the population would eventually die off. Alice finished scouring the <br>
      kitchen for food. She sighed, and was about to move on to the next house <br>
      until a hand clamped over her mouth and she was jerked backwards.
